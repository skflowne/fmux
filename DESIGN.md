## Product Context

- **What this is:** a Windows-first terminal multiplexer for AI coders — runs many
  terminal-based coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, …) in parallel, with an
  orchestrator brain, channels, and reboot-surviving supervision.
- **Who it's for:** developers running fleets of CLI agents who need to steer,
  supervise, and inspect them without losing raw-terminal ground truth.
- **Identity decision (owner, 2026-07-11):** **terminal-first**. Real terminals are
  the protagonist; chrome recedes and frames. We deliberately do NOT become a
  chat-first (Conductor) or dashboard-first app.

## Design Thesis

**"The calm command bridge for a fleet of terminal agents."**
A dim, warm-graphite cockpit where a single amber is the only lit instrument.
Terminals are the bridge's windows (the hero). Premium feel comes from warmth,
1px hairlines, tight radii, and type discipline — never from gradients,
glows, or effects. (Lineage: orca's "recede and frame", Warp's warm-minimal
discipline, Zed's quiet chrome, Codex's instrument footer.)

## Window Chrome (the "app, not a webpage in a window" layer)

- **No native menu bar visible.** `autoHideMenuBar: true` (Alt still reveals;
  accelerators keep working). The File/Edit strip was the #1 "looks like a
  plain window" offender.
- **Custom titlebar, 36px** (border-box). `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` +
  `titleBarOverlay: { color: <bgMantle>, symbolColor: <textSub>, height: 36 }`
  so Windows draws native snap-layout-capable window controls in theme colors.
- Titlebar contents: left segment (app mark + workspace name) is **tinted
  `--bg-mantle` and width-matched to the sidebar** so the top-left reads as one
  continuous panel with the sidebar (orca cue). Center stays **empty = drag
  region** (`-webkit-app-region: drag`; interactive children get `no-drag`).
  No search box in the titlebar (owner decision).
- `BrowserWindow.backgroundColor` must match the active theme's `bgBase`
  (no white flash on launch).
- The titlebar bottom divider is an inset hairline, not a border (keeps the
  36px content box exact).

## Layout Contract

└───────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

- **Left sidebar = navigation only** (workspaces). Agents do NOT live here.
- **Right column = mission control** (one pillar): **Fleet** (agent roster:
  status dot + name + mono activity line + jump `→`), then **Orchestrator**
  thread, busy bar at bottom. Channels is a sibling tab. Rationale: agents ↔
  the brain that commands them ↔ their channels are ONE system; splitting them
  across both edges made them feel unrelated (owner feedback, 2026-07-11).
- **Fleet vitals = appearing chips in the titlebar status strip** («N running»
  amber dot · «N need you» danger, click = jump to the most urgent pane).
  They render ONLY when nonzero — no dead gauges, no extra chrome row.
  (Owner decision 2026-07-12: the always-on bottom instrument strip read as
  dead chrome at "0 running" and was removed the same day it landed.)
- The terminal grid always gets the largest area. Any new surface must justify
  itself against "does this shrink the hero?"

## Color

- **Approach:** restrained. Warm graphite neutrals + a warm amber + a cool
  steel-blue counter-accent. Values are the `amber` theme tokens in `themes.ts`
  (`bgBase #151517 · bgMantle #19191C · bgSurface #202024 · textMain #EFEEEC ·
  textSub #A5A29C · textMuted #66645F · accent #E8A33D · accentSecondary
  (--accent-blue) #6E9BC4 · success #8FBF7F · danger #D96C6C`).
- **Two-accent grammar (owner 2026-07-15) — warm amber vs cool steel, each with
  ONE job.** Splits what was previously amber-overloaded ("alive AND focus AND
  links AND warning") so each color says exactly one thing:
  - **Warm accent (`--accent`, cursor variant `--accent-cursor`) = alive +
    attention + action:** running dots, spinners, terminal cursor, warning,
    "needs you" emphasis, unread badges, the footer model name — AND primary
    action (CTA) buttons. Actions are warm because pressing one makes the
    system DO something (alive), not GO somewhere (nav). A solid warm fill is
    reserved for the single primary action of a surface + tiny count badges;
    everything else warm is dots/rings/text. Budget: **5±2 warm meaning-points
    per screen** (dots of the same class count as one system).
  - **Steel-blue `--accent-blue` #6E9BC4 = navigation + interactive:** links,
    jump affordances, active-tab underline, focused-pane edge, focus rings,
    selection highlight. Reads as "where you are / what you click." An even
    quieter counter-accent than amber; **never fills areas** (same no-wash rule).
  - Focus moved from amber → steel (it's a "where you are" cue, not an "alive"
    one). The single `accentSecondary` token drives all of steel, so the hue is
    a 1-line change like the primary accent.
  - **Every theme carries the split** (`--accent` warm / `--accent-blue` cool):
    amber, nightowl, stars-and-stripes, taegeuk got dedicated cool/warm
    counterparts; catppuccin, red-dynasty, hinomaru already shipped two-tone;
    monochrome and void are exempt (colorlessness is their identity).
  - **Alive ≠ warning:** a theme's running/cursor hue must be perceptibly
    distinct from its warning hue (stars-and-stripes alive `#E89B4A` vs warning
    `#F2C85B`; taegeuk alive `#B87500` vs warning `#9B6A07`) so "running" never
    reads as "caution". Amber theme is the deliberate exception (one lit
    instrument: warning IS the amber).
- **No area washes.** Amber never fills areas. The only permitted wash is the
  danger `needs input` row. Accent may *expand* on hover only (links, AI-action
  buttons); at rest they are neutral.
- **Attention (danger) grammar:** one event = max 2 renditions (the evidence
  row + the global footer chip). Never three.
- **Terminal content owns its ANSI palette** (`amber-graphite` terminal theme):
  diffs/success are green, errors red — never theme-accent-colored. This keeps
  the hero visually separate from the chrome. Monochrome and Void apply their
  colorless identity to application chrome only; terminal ANSI semantics remain
  colored and distinct.
- **Hue is swappable by design:** the entire focus/accent identity hangs on the
  single `accent` token. Candidate alternates evaluated 2026-07-11: copper
  `#E08A57`, violet `#9E8CFF`, cyan `#5FB6C9`, green `#8FBF7F`. Amber kept for
  now; revisit freely — it is a 1-line change plus themes.
- Dark is primary. Light themes (hinomaru/taegeuk) follow the same grammar.
- **Forge theme (default, 2026-07-23):** comfortable charcoal-brown dark surfaces,
  ember orange for alive/action, muted steel-blue for navigation, and dedicated
  semantic ANSI colors. Green/red remain independent for diffs and terminal
  status; the orange identity never replaces them.

## Typography

- **UI/prose:** Inter (400/500/600). **Logs/paths/tool lines/terminal:** mono
  (Cascadia Code / JetBrains Mono). Rule: *prose in sans, logs in mono* — a
  mono line signals "machine evidence", a sans line signals "someone talking".
- Scale: 10px uppercase section labels (600, +0.09em) · 11px meta/tool lines ·
  13px body · 14px titles. Tabular figures for counters.
- **Hierarchy from typography, not decoration.** Speaker labels differ by
  weight/color (You = muted 600, Orchestrator = main 700), not by accent color.

## Spacing & Geometry

- **36px chrome module.** Every horizontal chrome row — titlebar, sidebar
  header/footer, pane tab strip, deck tabs, agent toolbar — is exactly 36px
  (`h-9`) so hairlines across the three columns land on the same y. A new
  chrome row must justify deviating from the module.
- Base unit 4px. Density: compact-leaning (rows 26–30px).
- Radii: **5px buttons/controls · 6px inputs · 7px cards/panels**. Never larger
  on chrome. Full-round only for status dots and count badges.
- Borders: 1px hairline `rgba(255,255,255,.06)` (dark). Panel seams via inset
  box-shadow hairlines, not borders.
- Elevation: exactly 3 levels (flat hairline / subtle surface lift / one
  floating shadow for popovers). Don't add a fourth.

## Component Rules

- **Tool calls render as flat mono log lines,** never boxed chips: status glyph
  (`●` running amber / `✓` ok green / `✕` error red) + tool name + one-line
  arg summary + right-aligned jump link (muted at rest, accent on hover).
- **Every claim is one click from its evidence:** anything referencing a pane
  gets a jump affordance (litmus test inherited from the deck).
- **gpui-style control surfacing (2026-07-15):** two physical treatments only.
  *Raised* (buttons, active segments, menu-item hover chips, cards): faint
  surface fill + 1px `color-mix(text-main 10%)` hairline + **top 1px inset
  highlight** (`inset 0 1px 0 color-mix(text-main 6%)`) — the "machined" look;
  press = 0.5px sink. *Recessed* (inputs, search): slightly-darker-than-base
  fill + inset shadow + **cool focus ring** (`--accent-blue` border + 3px 22%
  ring). All values via color-mix on tokens so every theme inherits them.
- **Primary action = solid warm fill** (`--accent` bg, `--bg-base` text, top
  inset highlight): the one filled button per surface. Secondary = raised
  neutral. Destructive = red tint at rest, solid red only for final confirm.
- Toolbar buttons are text-first, boxless until hover; hover shows a soft
  raised chip (not a color change alone). AI-directed actions (fan-out,
  broadcast) stay neutral at rest.
- **Terminal panes carry a scroll affordance at their right edge, and which one
  is state-dependent** (`src/renderer/terminal/scrollAffordance.ts`): the 6px
  Monaco scrollbar while xterm owns a real scroll range, and a **jog control**
  (`altScrollJog.ts`) on the alternate buffer, where a full-screen program owns
  scrolling and no protocol reports its position. The jog is a ribbed 10px grip
  on a short centred rail — deliberately not slider-shaped, since it claims a
  rate, not a position. Neutral at rest, `--accent-blue` on hover/drag
  (interactive, never a fill). Panes with nothing to scroll show neither.
- No emoji glyphs in chrome; use monochrome glyphs/icons only.
- Status dot vocabulary: amber = running · green = ok/idle-complete · gray =
  idle · red = needs input (with wash).

## Motion

- Minimal-functional. Spinners and blink-cursor are the only perpetual motion.
- Transitions ≤150ms ease-out, only for state changes (hover, expand, theme
  swap suppressed during switch).

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-07-11 | Terminal-first + premium chrome (not chat-first, not dashboard) | Raw-terminal ground truth is the moat; chrome was the gap |
| 2026-07-11 | Custom titlebar 36px, `autoHideMenuBar`, `titleBarOverlay`, no titlebar search | File/Edit strip killed the app feel; center = drag region (Warp cautionary tale) |
| 2026-07-11 | Unified mission control (Fleet + Orchestrator + Channels in right pillar; sidebar = workspaces only) | Agents/orchestrator/channels felt disconnected split across edges (owner feedback) |
| 2026-07-11 | Amber kept as focus hue; swappable via single `accent` token | Owner unsure on yellow — de-risked by token architecture + amber diet |
| 2026-07-11 | Amber diet codified (5±2 points, no washes, hover-expansion, diff=green, 2-rendition attention) | v1 mockup overused amber → read as "yellow app", not "one lit instrument" |
| 2026-07-11 | Status footer instrument strip (model·approval·ctx·cwd·running·needs) | Codex pattern; always-visible agent state |
| 2026-07-15 | Two-accent split: amber (`--accent-cursor`) = alive/attention, steel-blue (`--accent-blue` #6E9BC4) = navigation/interactive; focus moves amber→steel | `--accent-blue` was overloaded (157 renderer usages, all reading amber since accentSecondary==accent); one hue can't say "alive" AND "clickable". Cockpit warm/cool tension; `accentSecondary` token already existed for it |
| 2026-07-15 | gpui-style component surfacing: buttons/inputs/menus/cards get surface-lift + top inset-highlight (①), inputs recessed + accent focus ring (②); button radius 4→5px | Flat-to-the-point-of-unfinished read as cheap; adds crafted depth within the existing "elevation 3 levels" rule (not gradients/glows). Amber diet unchanged/improved |
| 2026-07-15 | Action = warm: primary/CTA buttons moved to `--accent` (solid warm fill, the one filled button per surface); new `--accent`/`--accent-rgb` semantic vars in every theme; alive≠warning hues for stars/taegeuk; 4 mono-accent themes gained the warm/cool split | Design review scored "primary=steel" as the brand-weakening flaw: the most important button read cold and amber demoted to a dot. Actions DO (warm), navigation GOES (cool) |
| 2026-07-19 | fan-out moved toolbar → deck control bar (revises the "AI-directed actions (fan-out, broadcast)" toolbar contract at Component Rules); Broadcast stays in the toolbar with an inline recessed popover (was a dead `window.prompt`) | fan-out is a fleet-spawn command → belongs next to Mode/Loop/Schedules, not the per-terminal toolbar; a deck-header/Fleet home dies on an empty fleet, the control bar renders on `activeWorkspaceId`. Broadcast's per-terminal scope matches the toolbar framing |
| 2026-07-19 | Menu IA = hybrid — Git·Review stay as deck tabs (not moved to center) + a warm Review badge (dirty-workspace count, reusing `metadata.gitSync` — no new polling); hunk diff stays center (DiffPanel); the orchestrator-model chip moves from the deck-tab header to the control bar | The "diff needs hero width" premise was false (diff already opens center via `addWorkspaceDiffSurface`); Git/Review are vertical rosters that belong on the deck. Always-on glance (dirty badge) beats hiding it behind a tab. Model chip frees the tab strip so 4 tabs + collapse fit the 248–320px deck |
| 2026-07-20 | 메뉴 IA=시안 A — Git·Review를 덱에서 중앙 페인 surface 탭으로 이관, 덱은 Orchestrator·Channels 2탭 (2026-07-19 hybrid 결정을 대체; Review dirty 뱃지도 롤백) | 오너가 시안 A를 명시 선택 — Git·Review 진입점을 각 페인의 SurfaceTabs 액션 클러스터로 옮겨 작업 맥락(활성 터미널 cwd) 옆에서 열고, 덱은 오케스트레이터/채널에 집중 |
| 2026-07-20 | fan-out은 에이전트 툴바로 복귀(2026-07-19 "toolbar→control bar" 결정 되돌림), 오케스트레이터 모델 선택은 컨트롤 바 칩에서 Agent 탭 인라인 드롭다운으로 이동 | fan-out 버튼을 툴바 우측(New chat 왼쪽)에 되돌려 함대 스폰 진입을 터미널 크롬에서 바로; 모델 선택은 탭 라벨 `Agent (모델)`을 활성 상태에서 재클릭해 여는 인라인 메뉴로 통합해 컨트롤 바를 Mode·Loop·Schedules로 정리 |
| 2026-07-20 | Git·Review=워크스페이스 헤더 탭(중앙 상단 행 우측)+중앙 전체 표면, 페인 탭=터미널·브라우저(·diff·editor) 전용 (같은 날 시안 A 페인-탭 결정을 대체) | Git·Review는 워크스페이스 단위 데이터인데 페인 surface 탭에 붙여 어색한 동작이 연쇄됐다(세트가 첫 터미널에 붙음, 분할 시 한쪽만, 다른 페인에서 점프, 좁은 탭 잘림). 헤더 탭으로 승격해 워크스페이스 스코프와 맞추고, 클릭 시 페인 그리드를 덮는 중앙 표면(GitTab/ReviewTab, max-w-720)으로 연다. 페인 그리드는 display로만 숨겨 터미널 PTY를 살린다. GitTab은 cwd prop 없이 활성 페인 cwd를 라이브로 따라간다 |
