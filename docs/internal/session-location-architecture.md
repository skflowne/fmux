# Session location architecture

`SessionLocation` describes where a pane's files and commands live. A cwd alone
is insufficient on Windows: `/home/me/repo` may belong to WSL, `/c/repo` may
belong to Git Bash, and the same WSL path may name different files in different
distributions.

The shared model is defined in `src/shared/sessionLocation.ts`:

```ts
type SessionLocation =
  | { domain: 'host'; cwd: string; shell: string }
  | { domain: 'msys'; cwd: string; shell: string }
  | { domain: 'wsl'; cwd: string; shell: string; distro?: string };
```

## Responsibilities

The shared module provides the canonical operations on this model:

- `parseSessionLocation` validates process-boundary input. It accepts legacy
  bare cwd strings as host locations; this preserves compatibility but does not
  prove that the path is host-accessible.
- `resolveSessionLocation` prefers a stored structured location and classifies
  legacy `{ cmd, cwd }` records only when no valid location is present.
- `classifySessionLocation` derives a domain from the shell and cwd. It cannot
  infer a WSL distribution from a Linux path such as `/home/me/repo`.
- `locationIdentity` and `locationsEqual` normalize locations for cache keys and
  equality without collapsing domains or WSL distributions.
- `preparePtyLocation` computes PTY spawn cwd/arguments. An unconvertible MSYS
  cwd degrades to the supplied safe host home and marks the result
  `degraded: true`.
- `toHostAccessiblePath` and `prepareLocationCommand` are filesystem and
  command conversion boundaries. They return explicit `LocationError` values
  when a conversion would require guessing.

`src/main/git/paneCommand.ts` adds the live-pane command boundary. A WSL command
requires an active context for the same pane and a known distribution; passive
metadata work must never start a distribution merely to answer a poll.

## Live pane state

Main-process metadata owns local-mode live pane state in
`src/main/ipc/handlers/metadata.handler.ts`:

- `paneIdentities` holds the cwd-independent shell and optional WSL
  distribution.
- `cwdMap` holds the current cwd reported by the live shell.
- `paneLocationSnapshots` publishes the combined location as an atomic
  `{ generation, revision, location }` value.
- `getPaneCommandTarget` combines them when a consumer needs to run a command.

Each new local pane ID starts a new generation. Cwd changes and late WSL
distribution enrichment increment its revision, and teardown cancels pending
enrichment before deleting the snapshot. `PTYBridge` forwards cwd changes only
through this owner; it does not separately publish raw cwd events that could
race the atomic location.

In daemon mode, `DaemonSession.location` is the durable record. The session
location transaction stages generation/revision candidates outside that
record, writes the exact candidate state, then commits and publishes it once.
Both cwd changes and late enrichment use this boundary. The daemon exposes only
committed snapshots on create, list, and reconnect responses. The daemon event
travels through `DaemonClient` and preload to the renderer as the same atomic
value. Main does not resolve or reclassify daemon-owned panes.

The renderer compares generation first and revision second. It queues an event
that arrives before surface binding, and ignores a stale RPC response that
arrives after a newer event. Main applies the same gate before changing its
command-target registry, so metadata consumers cannot regress even when an
enrichment event overtakes a create, list, or reconnect response. Projection
ordering is reset after an authenticated daemon replacement because the
replacement may start with lower generation numbers. An accepted renderer
snapshot also drives the owning workspace cwd and task-worktree departure state;
stale snapshots drive none of those side effects.

Closing a daemon session retires rather than deletes its main-process ordering
watermark. The daemon carries the exact generation on both natural-death and
explicit-destroy events, including destroys initiated by another authenticated
client and cases where main has not received the first snapshot yet. An RPC
response already in flight cannot resurrect that generation; the closed
snapshot itself is discarded, and only a strictly newer generation or a daemon
replacement reset can reuse the session ID.

Cwd candidates use an exact asynchronous write so frequent directory changes
do not block the daemon loop. Late enrichment uses a synchronous write with one
retry. Neither candidate mutates the session record before durability. Failed
writes therefore need no rollback and publish nothing. A successful write
commits the matching generation and revision before publication; ID reuse or a
newer transaction supersedes stale work. StateWriter serializes exact writes
with its existing queue, preserves unrelated pending metadata, and restores the
newest committed state if an older asynchronous write completes afterward.

The daemon reconnect path prefers the daemon's stored `location`;
`resolveSessionLocation` supplies the legacy `{ cmd, cwd }` fallback.

The renderer follows the same preference in
`src/renderer/utils/focusedSurface.ts`: a surface's stored location is
authoritative, while old surfaces without one are classified from `shell` and
`cwd`. Workspace metadata is only a final fallback when the active pane has no
usable surface.

Renderer equality calls must pass `window.electronAPI.platform`. The shared
module is also loaded in a context-isolated renderer where Node's `process` may
not exist, so its defensive default uses case-sensitive POSIX behavior.

## WSL distribution discovery

`src/shared/wslDistro.ts` is the single resolver implementation. It first reads
the actual spawn arguments (`-d` / `--distribution`) and child
`WSL_DISTRO_NAME` captured by the local PTY manager or daemon session manager.
When the pane carries neither fact, it resolves from `wsl.exe -l` variants,
accepting a single registered or single running distribution only when the
result is unambiguous.

Local mode runs the resolver from the main metadata registry. Daemon mode runs
it from the daemon session manager. Consumers receive the resulting stored
location and must not invoke the resolver themselves.

Enumeration never executes a command inside a distribution.
`createWslRunner` owns the bytes-to-text and process policy; `defaultRunner` is
only its production binding. The runner is Windows-only, reads raw buffers,
decodes either UTF-16LE or UTF-8, sets `WSL_UTF8=1`, hides the window, and
bounds the process with a three-second timeout and a 256 KiB output cap.

Enumeration results have a 60-second TTL, and concurrent callers share the same
in-flight promise. Results with no registered names, and rejected enumerations,
are removed immediately so the next call retries. A partial result is cached
when the quiet registered-name listing succeeds but another listing fails.
There is currently no production hook that invalidates the cache when a
distribution is installed or removed; `resetWslDistroCache` exists for test
isolation. Therefore an install/remove can remain invisible until the TTL
expires.

## Fail-closed boundaries

The architecture preserves compatibility without treating incomplete context as
authority:

- A legacy bare cwd is parsed as host, but Windows filesystem conversion rejects
  unresolved guest-shaped paths with `UNRESOLVED_GUEST_PATH`.
- A WSL Linux path without a distribution fails with
  `WSL_DISTRO_REQUIRED`.
- A WSL command without matching live-pane context fails with
  `ACTIVE_CONTEXT_REQUIRED` or `WSL_DISTRO_MISMATCH`.
- An unsupported MSYS or WSL path is rejected instead of being passed to a
  Windows API unchanged.

Tests should exercise the boundary that owns each behavior. Parser and
conversion cases belong in `src/shared/__tests__/sessionLocation.test.ts`;
generation-aware enrichment belongs in
`src/shared/__tests__/sessionLocationEnrichment.test.ts`; WSL byte decoding and
process policy belong below the runner seam in
`src/main/pty/__tests__/wslDistro.test.ts`; atomic projection and live
identity/cwd ordering belong at the daemon manager, preload, renderer store, and
registered PTY handler boundaries.
