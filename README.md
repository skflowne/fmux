# Forge Mux

### The workspace multiplexer for AI coding agents.

Run **fleets of Claude Code, Codex & Gemini in parallel** — each agent in its own pane, or fan one prompt out into **N isolated git worktrees** you review **hunk by hunk**. Native on **Windows & macOS**, with approval gates, agent-to-agent channels, and a **real browser your agents drive**. Walk away — after a crash or **full OS reboot**, they come back mid-conversation.

> **What's a *workspace multiplexer*?** tmux splits a terminal. Forge Mux multiplexes whole **workspaces** — terminals, agents, git worktrees, a browser, and the channels they coordinate over — all owned by a daemon that keeps them running across quits, crashes, and full reboots. **One window. One fleet. Windows & macOS.**

## Fork maintenance

Forge Mux preserves upstream wmux source structure so upstream updates remain
reviewable and practical to rebase. Only user-facing and collision-facing
boundaries use the `fmux` identity: installation and CLI names, release sources,
application IDs, data directories, IPC endpoints, project config filenames, and
integration destinations.

Development happens on `develop`, rebased onto `origin/main` and verified. A
release promotes that verified delta to `main` as one squash merge. The fmux
identity layer is the range of fork-local commits above the upstream base
(`git merge-base main origin/main`); to pull upstream changes, run
`git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main main`, which replays the whole
layer onto the new upstream tip.

Forge Mux versioning restarts at 1.0.0, and this repository's `v*` tags mark
Forge Mux releases only — wmux's historical release tags live in the upstream
repository. Release tags are pushed individually (`git push fork vX.Y.Z`,
never bare `git push --tags`), and clones set
`git config remote.origin.tagOpt --no-tags` so upstream fetches don't
re-import wmux tags.

## ⚡ Install in 30 seconds

**Windows** — one-liner (downloads the latest Setup.exe and verifies its SHA-256 before running it):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skflowne/fmux/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

<sub>or [**download Setup.exe**](https://github.com/skflowne/fmux/releases/latest) directly — either way a SmartScreen prompt appears because the installer isn't Authenticode-signed yet ([why?](#install-help)). Once installed, Forge Mux keeps itself up to date via the in-app updater.</sub>

**macOS / Linux** — prebuilt binaries aren't published yet; Forge Mux currently ships Windows installers only. Both platforms build and run from source (see [Build from source](#build-from-source)).

## 🤔 Why Forge Mux?

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 🧵 **One prompt → N agents → merge the best** | Fan out a prompt into up to 8 tasks, each in an **isolated git worktree** with its own agent pane and a private mission channel. Review each task's diff side by side, **adopt hunks all-or-nothing**, then close it or open a **PR in one click** — leftovers land in a cleanup list, never as mystery folders. |
| 🌿 **Git & GitHub live in the dock** | A **Git tab** shows the worktrees of the repo behind your active pane — create, open as a workspace, or remove — plus its **pull requests and comments** (GitHub via `gh`, GitLab via `glab`, including self-hosted). A read-only **workspace diff** is one palette command away, and from any hunk you can **ask the orchestrator** with the code attached. No alt-tabbing to the browser to see if review feedback landed. |
| 🪟 **Many agents, one window** | Split panes + workspaces. Claude on the left, Codex on the right, Gemini running tests below — simultaneously. |
| 🤝 **Agents coordinate, not just coexist** | Agent-to-agent messaging + task delegation, plus **channels** — Slack-style rooms several agents read, post, and get @-mentioned into. An **execute approval gate** stops any agent running code in your workspace without your OK. This is the multi-agent moat. |
| 🌐 **Agents drive a *real* browser** | Built-in Chrome over CDP. Say *"search Google for this"* and your agent actually clicks, types, and screenshots. Works with React inputs and CJK text. |
| 🧭 **Fleet View cockpit** | `Ctrl+Shift+A` — every agent across every workspace in an **always-on side panel** (other panes stay live), blocked ones floated to the top with a live activity line. Clear every stuck approval from one **inbox**; click any card to jump straight there. |
| 🔔 **Knows when an agent finishes** | Desktop notification + taskbar flash on completion. Flags `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE` for your approval. |
| 💾 **Survives quit, crash & reboot** | A tmux-style daemon owns every PTY. Reopen and your sessions are **still running — processes and all.** A pane declared in `fmux.json` is **supervised like an init system** — auto-restarted across crashes and reboots (the app relaunches at login), resuming the *exact* Claude conversation it was on. |
| 🤖 **Zero-config MCP** | Launch Forge Mux and Claude Code just works — **84 tools** (browser, terminal, panes, channels, A2A) register themselves, scoped to the workspace that called them. |

## ✨ Highlights

- 🧵 **Task fan-out & harvest** — one prompt → N worktree-isolated tasks (idempotent, per-task compensation) · side-by-side diff with **hunk adoption** (all-or-nothing `git apply`) · close / one-click PR / cleanup list · mission channels record every decision
- 🌿 **Git surface** — a **Git tab** in the dock: worktrees (create / open-as-workspace / remove, no force-delete) + **pull requests & comments** for the active repo (GitHub via `gh`, GitLab via `glab`, self-hosted included) · read-only **workspace diff** from the palette · **ask the orchestrator about a hunk** with the code attached
- 🔁 **One-click loops** — put the orchestrator on an objective with optional per-iteration **steps** (a `/`-picker autocompletes your `.claude` skills), a done-when checklist, and a cadence; it keeps working across restarts, event-woken by your agents, and stopping fails closed to report-only
- 🤝 **A2A multi-agent** — agents message + delegate tasks by pane, gated by a per-pane execute approval, with a pollable task inbox + symmetric reply
- 💬 **Channels** — Slack-style rooms agents read, post, and get @-mentioned into · server-verified sender · durable per-agent inbox · `fmux channel` CLI · operators can self-join private agent rooms (audited)
- 🤖 **Agent supervision** — declare a pane in `fmux.json` (trust-gated) and the daemon keeps it alive: restart policy, backoff, reboot survival
- 🖥️ **Native PTY (ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS) + xterm.js WebGL** rendering · 999K-line scrollback · Unicode 11 (correct CJK / emoji)
- ⌨️ **Tmux-style prefix** (`Ctrl+B` + key, 13 actions) · **floating pane** (`` Ctrl+` ``) · scroll bookmarks
- 🔀 **Multiview** — several workspaces side by side · layout templates · drag-to-reorder sidebar
- 🧩 **Plugin host** — sandboxed iframe plugins with an explicit permission model
- 🛡️ **Token-authed IPC**, SSRF guard, PTY input sanitization, randomized CDP port, Electron Fuses
- 📱 **`wmux web`** — your live panes in a phone browser (PWA-installable), read-only and loopback-only by default; input and network exposure are explicit, warned-about opt-ins
- ⬆️ **In-app auto-update** on Windows and macOS (arm64) — checked every 30 minutes, SHA-256 verified against a published manifest before it installs
- 🎨 **10 UI themes** (Amber by default · Catppuccin · Nightowl · Monochrome · Void · Hinomaru · Taegeuk · Stars & Stripes · Red Dynasty · Custom) and **10 terminal palettes**, light ones included &nbsp;·&nbsp; 🌏 **23 locales scaffolded** — English & 한국어 complete, 日本語 / 中文 in progress — **[translations welcome](https://github.com/skflowne/fmux/labels/good%20first%20issue)**

> 💡 **Tip:** point Claude Code at the MCP tools (`browser_open`, `terminal_read`, `pane_list`, `a2a_task_send`, `channel_post`) or script the `fmux` CLI (`fmux send` / `read-screen` / `list-panes` / `fmux channel post`) to orchestrate panes programmatically.

<summary><b>📦 &nbsp;Full feature list</b></summary>

<br>

**Terminal** — xterm.js + WebGL, native PTY (ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS), Unicode 11 width tables, split panes, tabs, floating pane, smart right-click (selection→copy / empty→paste / link menu), scroll bookmarks, Vi copy mode, regex search, 999K scrollback with disk persistence, shell integration (OSC 133) for semantic command boundaries (Constrained Language Mode safe).

**Keybindings** — Tmux-style prefix mode (`Ctrl+B`, 13 default actions), fully customizable, reset-to-defaults.

**Workspaces** — drag-and-drop sidebar, `Ctrl+1~9` quick switch, multiview, layout templates, full session persistence (layout / tabs / cwd / scrollback), Fleet View cockpit.

**Browser + CDP** — built-in panel (`Ctrl+Shift+L`), nav bar / DevTools / back-forward, element Inspector (hover-highlight, click-to-copy LLM context), full automation: click / fill / type / screenshot / JS eval / key press.

**Notifications** — output-throughput activity detection (not pattern matching, works with any agent), native OS toasts + taskbar flash (Windows) / Dock & menu-bar tray (macOS), process-exit alerts, notification panel (`Ctrl+I`), Web Audio cues.

**Agent detection** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI. Detects start → activates monitoring, warns on critical actions.

**Task journey (fan-out → diff → PR)** — spawn up to 8 `WorkTask` missions from one prompt, each with a dedicated git worktree on a fresh `wtask/*` branch, its own task workspace, a private mission channel, and a file-backed initial prompt. Idempotency-keyed end to end; per-task failures compensate individually, and worktrees are preserved — never force-deleted. Harvest through a diff surface (file tree, unified diff, per-hunk checkboxes; adoption is a single all-or-nothing `git apply` gated by a target snapshot so the target is fully changed or fully untouched), comment straight into the mission channel, then close the task (the worktree is removed only after a clean check — dirty output is preserved and the close is held) or open a PR with one click (`gh`-gated, idempotent re-entry). A palette cleanup list scans the worktree root for leftovers, and missions show up in the sidebar and fleet panel.

**Multi-agent (A2A)** — agent-to-agent messaging + task delegation addressed by pane/surface, same-workspace and cross-workspace. Per-pane **execute approval gate** (a remote agent can't spawn a `bypassPermissions` worker in your workspace without your approval). Symmetric reply (a reply returns to the exact pane that asked), pollable task inbox on the EventBus, broadcast, and a unified approval inbox in Fleet View.

**Channels** — Slack-style rooms for a workspace's agents: create / join / invite / post / read / archive, each message carrying a server-verified sender — shown as the sender's pane identity chip plus a per-workspace color badge, so you can tell agents apart at a glance. A durable per-member inbox (unread + @-mention counts, survives reboot), a human-readable right-side dock, and a headless `fmux channel` CLI (`unread` / `read` / `post` / `ack` / `join` / `list`) so a nudged agent can catch up and reply.

**Supervision & fmux.json** — declare panes/agents in a trust-gated `fmux.json` (auto-layout + custom commands). The daemon supervises declared agent panes like an init system: restart policy with backoff across process exits, daemon restarts, and full reboots, with a runaway-crash guard — and it resumes the exact agent conversation on restart, not a fresh shell.

**Plugins** — sandboxed iframe plugin host with a bridge + explicit permission model and pane decorations.

**Daemon** — background session management (survives app restart), scrollback dump + auto-recovery, start-at-login registration on Windows and macOS (relaunches after reboot), dead-session TTL reaping.

**MCP tools** — `browser_*` (open / navigate / screenshot / snapshot / click / fill / type / evaluate / press_key), `terminal_read` / `terminal_read_events` (OSC 133) / `terminal_send` / `terminal_send_key`, `workspace_list` / `surface_list` / `surface_new` / `pane_list` / `pane_split` / `pane_close` / `pane_focus`, `channel_*` (create / post / read / ack / invite / join / list), `a2a_*` agent-to-agent + task delegation, `company_a2a_*`, `wmux_events_poll` / `wmux_search_panes`. Every browser tool takes a `surfaceId` so each session drives its own browser.

<summary><b>❓ &nbsp;FAQ + install troubleshooting</b></summary>

<br>

**Is Forge Mux a tmux port?** No — tmux was the inspiration, not the base. Forge Mux is a native **workspace multiplexer** on Electron (ConPTY on Windows, forkpty on macOS): tmux-*style* split panes, prefix keys, and session persistence, but it also multiplexes agents, git worktrees, a browser, and channels. No WSL / Cygwin / MSYS2.

**Which Macs are supported?** Apple Silicon (arm64), building from source — prebuilt `.dmg` releases aren't published yet; open an issue if you need one. If Gatekeeper warns on first launch, right-click the app → **Open**.

**Can I reach my panes from my phone?** Yes — `fmux web` serves your live panes to a browser (PWA-installable). It is **read-only and loopback-only by default**; `--allow-input` and `--expose` are explicit opt-ins, and even read-only shows a pane's full scrollback to whoever can reach the port, so keep it behind Tailscale rather than the open internet.

**Works with Claude Code / Codex / Gemini?** Yes. Forge Mux auto-detects them and registers an MCP server so they can drive the browser and read terminal output.

**Multiple agents at once?** Yes. Each pane is an independent PTY, and agents coordinate over A2A MCP tools — message each other, delegate tasks by pane, reply to the exact pane that asked, and gate any cross-agent code execution behind your approval.

**Feels heavy, or a workspace switch is slow?** See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) — what runs while a pane is hidden, the daemon's `config.json` knobs, and how to self-diagnose with `fmux doctor`.

**"Windows protected your PC" warning?** The release pipeline signs `Setup.exe` through [SignPath](https://signpath.io/), but currently with a test certificate that Windows does not trust, so SmartScreen still reports an unknown publisher. It's safe to click **More info → Run anyway**; the install one-liner verifies the Setup.exe SHA-256 against the release manifest before running it.

**Installer blocked with no "Run anyway"?** **Smart App Control (SAC)** on Windows 11 can block unsigned binaries outright. Check with `Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object SmartAppControlState`. SAC uses cloud reputation, so blocks are often transient — retry later, or build from source ([#200](https://github.com/skflowne/fmux/issues/200)).

**How do updates work?** The app checks GitHub releases every 30 minutes, downloads the new installer in the background, verifies its SHA-256 against the published manifest, and offers a one-click "Restart to install" (a manual *Check for updates* in Settings installs in one step). Your sessions persist in the daemon across the restart — no need to re-run the install script.
