// ─── A2A Channels renderer state ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Mirrors the daemon-side `ChannelState` in the renderer for the sidebar
// (U7) + composer (U8) + unread-badge surfaces.
//
// Two paths drive mutations:
//
//   1. Event-driven (the authoritative path): a
//      `useChannelsEventSubscription` hook (mounted in AppLayout, see
//      `src/renderer/hooks/useChannelsEventSubscription.ts`) runs an
//      `events.poll` loop scoped to `channel.message` and dispatches
//      `appendMessageFromEvent` for each event the daemon fans out to
//      the current workspace. Channel create/archive/join/leave surface
//      in the slice via the post-event refresh path — the daemon emits
//      the relevant channel lifecycle and the slice reads the result
//      back through `refreshChannels`.
//
//   2. User-initiated: the sidebar/composer calls the `*Daemon` thunks
//      (`createChannelDaemon` / `postMessageDaemon`) for round-tripping
//      to the daemon. The `*Daemon` thunks await the RPC result and,
//      on success, call the matching `*Optimistic` thunk to apply the
//      authoritative row to the local mirror. On failure, the `*Daemon`
//      thunk returns the structured `ChannelError` envelope without
//      mutating local state — the caller (sidebar/composer) branches on
//      `result.error.code` for the user-visible error branch. The
//      `*Optimistic` thunks stay as the state-mirror-only primitive for
//      callers that arrange the daemon round-trip out of band (tests,
//      out-of-band MCP flows).
//
// Why a separate `*Daemon` layer (vs. making `*Optimistic` async):
//   - The `*Optimistic` primitives stay synchronous so tests can drive
//     state without a bridge mock.
//   - The `*Daemon` thunks are the wire-path entry points; their job is
//     RPC + error-mapping, NOT state mutation. State mutation always
//     goes through `*Optimistic` for one source of truth.
//
// Bridge access: `useRpcBridge` installs `window.__wmuxChannelsRpc` on
// mount; the `*Daemon` thunks read it lazily (mirroring the
// `searchSlice.runSearch` pattern at `src/renderer/stores/slices/
// searchSlice.ts:122-130`). If the bridge isn't mounted, the thunk
// warns and returns an `UNKNOWN` error rather than throwing — the
// caller still gets a structured error to branch on.
//
// Per-recipient scoping: the event hook filters by `recipientWorkspaceIds`
// before dispatching, so `appendMessageFromEvent` can trust that the
// message belongs to the current workspace and never needs to re-check.
//
// Failure surfacing: every action that takes an external result accepts
// `{ ok, ... } | { ok: false, error }`. The slice never throws on a
// failed mutation; the caller is expected to branch on the structured
// `error.code` (PERSIST_FAILED on the post path is the U2 maintainer
// directive — surfaced verbatim, not swallowed).
//
// Plan reference: U4 (create/post wire-up), U6 (state mirror).
