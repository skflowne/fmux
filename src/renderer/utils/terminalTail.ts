 *
 * NO `offsetWidth` / `isConnected` guard — see `scrollbackDump.ts:86` for the
 * guard that must NOT be copied here. AppLayout mounts every background pane
 * with `display:none`, so every inactive pane's xterm element reports
 * `offsetWidth === 0`; copying that guard would blank the tail for the entire
 * background fleet (i.e. the majority of cards). The buffer contents are valid
 * regardless of whether the element is laid out, so we read unconditionally,
 * gated only on the ptyId being present in the registry.

 *  terminalOutputScheduler) is budgeted; reads bypassed it entirely. Bounding
 *  the default to recent output aligns with the tool's own headline ("read the
 *  current visible text") and cuts per-read cost from O(scrollback) to O(N).

 * window ending at the cursor line rather than walking the whole buffer, so a
 * burst of reads (an orchestrator observing its fleet) cannot pin the renderer
 * thread parsing 10k-row backlogs. Interior empty lines between content are
 * preserved (matching the full read's semantics for the last N rows). A pane

 * lines between content — matching the full-read's `slice(-n)` semantics for
 * the common case.

 * Bounded-scan trade-off: a pathological buffer whose cursor sits far below the

 * instead of walking the whole scrollback. That is acceptable for a triage
 * glance at a card — `input.readScreen` remains exact when precision matters.
