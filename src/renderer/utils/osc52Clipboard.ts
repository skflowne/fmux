/**
 * OSC 52 clipboard-write decode + security policy (pure).
 *
 * Background:
 * Full-screen TUI apps (Claude Code, vim, tmux, neovim, …) take over the mouse
 * (mouse tracking mode), so a drag no longer lands an xterm-native selection.
 * When the user copies, those apps don't touch the OS clipboard directly — they
 * can't, they run sandboxed inside the terminal — they emit an OSC 52 escape
 * sequence (`ESC ] 52 ; Pc ; Pd ST`) asking the *terminal* to do it. xterm.js
 * disables OSC 52 by default (its read half leaks clipboard contents to any
 * program that asks), so without an explicit handler wmux silently drops the
 * request: the app shows "copied", the system clipboard never changes.
 *
 * This module is the pure decode + policy core. `useTerminal` registers the
 * thin xterm OSC-52 handler that feeds it the raw payload and writes the result
 * through the existing clipboard IPC (which already enforces a 1 MB cap and
 * surfaces lock failures). Kept DOM-free so it unit-tests in the node vitest env.
 *
 * Security policy — we open the WRITE half only:
 *   • READ requests (`Pd === '?'`) are REFUSED — never let an app exfiltrate the
 *     user's clipboard. This read leak is the whole reason xterm ships OSC 52 off.
 *   • CLEAR requests (empty `Pd`) are REFUSED — an app should not be able to
 *     silently wipe the clipboard.
 *   • Oversized payloads are REFUSED before decode — a multi-megabyte base64
 *     blob shouldn't be allocated/decoded on the main thread (DoS). The clipboard
 *     IPC's 1 MB cap is the second line of defense on the decoded text.
 *   • Malformed / non-base64 payloads are REFUSED.
 * Writing the system clipboard is allowed: the app is something the user ran,
 * and a clipboard write (unlike a read) leaks nothing.
