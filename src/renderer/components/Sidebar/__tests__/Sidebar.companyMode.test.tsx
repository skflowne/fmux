// ─── Regression guard: Sidebar must consume sidebarMode → render CompanyPanel ─
//
// Bug: the palette's "Company: …" commands set `sidebarMode = 'company'`, but
// NOTHING in the renderer read `sidebarMode` to swap the sidebar content — the
// `CompanyPanel` component was never rendered (orphaned). So company commands
// mutated state with no visible effect ("looks clickable but does nothing").
//
// The store-connected <Sidebar /> can't be behavior-tested in this repo's
// node-env harness (renderToStaticMarkup doesn't run effects, and the store
// can't be seeded reliably without a mount — the same reason AppLayout/Sidebar
// have no render fixtures). So this is a SOURCE-SCAN lockstep guard (the same
// pattern as firstParty.test.ts scanning src/mcp): it pins the wiring in source
// so the consumer can't silently regress to orphaned again.

  // its entry stays in the command palette rather than a sidebar affordance;

  // wiring above (sidebarMode → <CompanyPanel />) is still pinned so the mode
