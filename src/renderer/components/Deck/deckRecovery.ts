// ─── Command Deck — fleet recovery greeting (P3b) ───────────────────────────
//
// After an OS reboot the daemon replays every pane's SHELL, but the agents that
// were running inside them are gone — each recovered pane gets a per-pane
// resume pill. P3b adds the fleet-level affordance: a greeting card in the
// Commander thread ("N agent panes can be recovered — recover the fleet?")
// whose button sends ONE canned prompt to the brain, which then types the
// resume command into every recovered pane via terminal_send and reports back.
//
// Policy split (substrate neutrality): wmux only computes the FACTS — which
// panes are recoverable and the exact resume command each one needs (the same
// gates the pill applies: resumable grammar, agent↔binding match, cwd match).
// The exact-session form also restores the RECORDED permission mode (e.g.
// `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) — without it a bypass-mode fleet comes back
// stuck on prompts, which isn't a recovery. D6 ("permission restore only on
// explicit user intent") is satisfied by the card's button click / the typed
// recovery request — both are the human explicitly asking for their fleet
// back as it was. Executing and narrating the recovery is the brain's job,
// through the same terminal_send any agent gets. There is no deterministic
// "recover all" engine in app code.
//
// Pure + store-free so every piece is unit-testable with plain objects.

 *   - the agent must have a resume grammar (non-resumable agents are excluded
 *     daemon-side already; re-checked here defensively);
 *   - the pane's recovered PTY must have emitted its first data
 *     (`ptyReadyByPtyId`) — the pill waits for the same signal before typing,
 *     because a write into a not-yet-interactive recovered pipe is silently
 *     lost (EI6 / codex P2). The map is reactive, so a not-ready pane simply
 *     appears on the card once it comes up.
 *   - the exact-session form additionally requires the binding to be for the
 *     SAME agent and the pane's live cwd to still match the binding's origin
 *     cwd (`--resume` is cwd-scoped) — otherwise the cwd-relative fallback.
 * Panes whose ptyId no longer maps to a live pane are skipped.
