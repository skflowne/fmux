// macOS-specific error catalog.
//
// Tier 2 Rust-style messages: state the problem, name the cause, and give the
// user the exact command they should run. New macOS users hit a small set of
// well-known speed bumps (Gatekeeper, Xcode CLT missing, MCP file ACLs, brew
// tap discovery, Playwright quarantine). Centralizing the wording keeps every
// surface (CLI banner, registrar throw, MCP server stderr) on the same script.
//
// This module only DEFINES the catalog. Wiring it into specific catch sites
// (registrar ENOACCES, etc.) happens in a follow-up batch — see the task brief.
// Do not import this from runtime call sites yet.
