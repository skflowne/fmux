/**
 * `wmux setup-hooks` — install the wmux ↔ Claude Code hook bridge directly into
 * Claude Code's user settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`), WITHOUT requiring the
 * `/plugin marketplace add` flow. This is the plugin-LESS alternative to the
 * `wmux-claude-integration` Claude Code plugin: same 4 hook events, same proven
 * bridge script, but registered by editing settings.json instead of installing a
 * marketplace plugin.
 *
 * Why settings.json + a stable bridge path (NOT the install dir):
 *   Squirrel.Windows installs wmux into versioned `app-x.y.z` directories that
 *   change on every update. A hook command pointing into the install dir would
 *   break the moment the app updates. So we copy the bridge to a stable location
 *   under `~/.wmux/hooks/` and reference THAT path from settings.json — it
 *   survives app updates, and every `setup-hooks` run refreshes the copy so the
 *   bridge stays in sync with the installed app.
 *
 * Style mirrors `src/cli/commands/mcp.ts`: atomic tmp+rename writes,
 * prototype-pollution-safe JSON.parse reviver, findScript() upward-walk asset
 * discovery, and RegisterOutcome-style result objects.

wmux setup-hooks — install Claude Code hooks without the marketplace plugin

USAGE
  wmux setup-hooks [--remove | --status] [--json]

ACTIONS (mutually exclusive; default = install)
  (default)    Install wmux hook entries into ~/.claude/settings.json and copy
               the bridge to ~/.wmux/hooks/wmux-bridge.mjs.
  --remove     Remove only the wmux-owned hook entries (leaves your other hooks).
  --status     Report whether wmux hooks are installed, whether the copied bridge
               is up to date, and a double-signal warning if the plugin is also
               installed.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json       Output raw JSON (useful for scripting).

 * path so it survives Squirrel's `app-x.y.z` swap, which is exactly why an app
 * update never refreshed it — the user had to re-run `wmux setup-hooks` by hand,
 * and a stale bridge silently keeps its old behavior (a real case: the log
 * rotation + activity-stamp throttle from the "30+ sessions" scaling fix never
 * reached an already-installed bridge, so its bridge.log grew without bound).
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow — this owns ONLY the plugin-LESS copy under
 * `~/.wmux/hooks/`, and only when settings.json actually references it. It does
 * NOT touch the marketplace plugin's own bridge under
 * `~/.claude/plugins/cache/…` — that copy is versioned and updated by Claude
 * Code's plugin system, not by wmux. And like the statusline refresh it never
 * writes settings.json, so it cannot enroll a user or resurrect a hook they
 * removed: no wmux hook groups → 'not-installed', nothing happens.
 *
 * The settings reference is checked BEFORE the file is read, so a hook still
 * pointing at a bridge that has since been deleted is REPAIRED rather than
 * written off as uninstalled — otherwise every configured hook would keep
 * targeting a nonexistent file and this reconcile would never fix it.
 *
 * tmp+rename because the bridge is spawned on every Stop/SubagentStop/etc.; a
 * plain copy could hand a half-written script to a hook firing mid-copy. The
