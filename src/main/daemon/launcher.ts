 *  - The PID is the one captured when the shutdown was acked, NEVER re-read
 *    from daemon.pid. Between ack and backstop another app instance may have
 *    already spawned a replacement daemon and rewritten the pid file; a
 *    file-read here would SIGKILL the fresh daemon.
 *  - `definitiveOnly: true` refuses to kill when the image or cmdline lookup
 *    is indeterminate (null — AV blocking tasklist/ps/WMI). The replacement
 *    path deliberately waits up to ~5s after asking the daemon to die, which
 *    is long enough for PID reuse to stop being "near-impossible"; the
