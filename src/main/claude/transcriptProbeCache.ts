/**
 * Cache for transcript-existence probes.
 *
 * Invariant: **a recorded answer is revalidated once `ttlMs` has passed, and an
 * unreachable guest is never evidence of absence.**
 *
 * The second half bounds the first. A refresh that cannot reach the guest
 * records no answer, so `lives()` goes on serving the last one it has for as
 * long as the guest stays unreachable — past `ttlMs`, without limit. That is
 * deliberate: discarding a retained answer because the guest went idle is the
 * "could not look" → "it is not there" collapse this module exists to prevent.
 * An answer is at most `ttlMs` old only while the guest can still answer.
 *
 * Why this is its own module. The host branch of a transcript liveness probe is
 * one local `lstat`, but the WSL branch spawns `wsl.exe` and blocks for up to
 * WSL_READ_TIMEOUT_MS. The daemon probes from its `listSessions` handler — a
 * per-poll stat — so N WSL panes would stall the daemon event loop N × 750 ms on
 * every poll, delaying PTY data forwarding and every other RPC. A transcript
 * appearing or being deleted is rare, so the first answer for a key is resolved
 * for real and later polls are served from cache while a refresh runs out of
 * band, keeping the call sites synchronous.
 *
 * That mechanism previously lived inline next to the probe itself with two write
 * paths whose error rules contradicted each other: the synchronous one recorded
 * every failure as "does not exist", while the asynchronous one refused to. Here
 * there is exactly one writer of an answer — `record` — and exactly one error
 * rule: an `unreachable` outcome never becomes an answer.
 *
 * Three states, not two. A key can be unknown (probe it, blocking, once), or
 * known-and-answered, or known-but-never-answered. The third state is what makes
 * "cannot probe" survivable: it records the *attempt* so repeat polls neither
 * block nor re-spawn, while recording no *answer*, so nothing can later mistake
 * it for evidence the transcript is gone.

/**
 * The result of one probe attempt.
 *
 * `unreachable` means the probe could not run or could not be trusted to have

 * probe ran and the file was not there.
