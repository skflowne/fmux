 * on a question, and pressed Enter expecting to submit a line that was never
 * there.
 *
 * The Stop hook already hands us `transcript_path` (hooks.rpc.ts stores it on

 * structured data. Reading them here means the wake event can carry the
 * question itself — the same treatment `pr.review_comment` already gives
