 * Codex review catch: PostToolUse populates surfaceActivity (+ its freshness

 * matching the detector (hook-only agents, or any turn once the hook-authority
 * veto suppresses the detector) left Fleet View showing the pane as
 * "running: <last tool>" for the full HOOK_RUNNING_TTL_MS (120s) after the turn
 * was actually done — a stale status that reads as "still working" right when it
 * finished. Cleared on agent.stop (the turn definitively ended) and
 * agent.session_start (fresh session on this ptyId — a previous session's tool
 * label must not leak in). NOT on agent.subagent_stop: a Task-tool subagent
 * finishing happens WITHIN the parent turn, which may still have more tool calls
 * coming, so clearing there would erase live activity. `activity: ''` is the
 * established clear signal (setSurfaceActivity deletes both the string and its
 * freshness timestamp on a falsy value).
 *
 * The same turn boundary also decides the pane's PENDING QUESTION, so both
 * fields ride ONE broadcast — a stop is a single state transition and must not
 * fan out as two IPC messages. `pendingQuestion` lets a poller (`pane_list`, the
 * sidebar) tell "finished" from "blocked on an answer" without reading the
 * terminal, where an agent's printed question is indistinguishable from text
 * pending in its input box. It is written on EVERY stop: a stop that asks
 * nothing CLEARS a question left by an earlier turn, otherwise a pane reads as
 * blocked forever. session_start clears it for the same reason it clears
 * activity.
 *
 * `agentStatus: 'complete'` is hook-authoritative turn completion. A long-lived
 * agent TUI (OpenCode, etc.) is a foreground command the WHOLE time it is open,
 * so the byte-silence heuristic (ActivityMonitor) never flips it to idle — its
 * periodic repaints keep the idle timer perpetually rescheduled — and no precise
 * idle-prompt detector event ever lands. The pane was therefore stuck reporting
 * 'running' forever between turns, both in the fleet badge (via ws metadata /
 * surfaceAgent) and in `pane_list` (surfaceAgent.status), misleading the
 * orchestrator and hiding the finished pane from the heartbeat level review
 * (which only scans attention statuses). 'complete' is an ATTENTION status that
 * outranks the busy-derived 'running' in selectFleetPanes and flows to
 * surfaceAgent for pane_list. A genuinely new turn re-arms 'running' via
 * ActivityMonitor.onActive / a fresh awaiting_input hook, both of which clear
 * this attention entry (setSurfaceAgentStatus drops any non-attention status).
 * session_start is a turn BEGINNING, not an end, so it must not set it.

/**
 * Decide how this signal resolves its workspace list, cheapest source first.
 * Three tiers, each removing more of the renderer dependency than the last:
 *
 *   (1) MIRROR — the main-side WorkspaceMirror, a full workspace tree the
 *       renderer PUSHES to main on every structural/status change. When it is
 *       populated, fresh (younger than STALE_TRUST_MS), AND the pure resolver
 *       actually resolves a pane against its entries, we route off it with ZERO
 *       renderer involvement — the strongest cure for the hook jank, because it
 *       serves BOTH ptyId- and workspaceId-only signals (the renderer already
 *       pushed the current active-surface mapping, so activePtyId is as fresh as
 *       a push allows). An empty/never-populated mirror, a stale one, or a signal
 *       the resolver can't place falls through to (2)/(3).
 *   (2) ENV FAST PATH (Fix B) — peek the pull-cache's last-known list without a
 *       fetch, under the strict same-ptyId guard below.
 *   (3) BLOCKING PULL — the authoritative `workspace.list` round-trip.
 *
 * The round-trip (`workspace.list` → renderer) is what a large-buffer flush
 * storm starves: while the renderer is pegged parsing a multi-MB terminal
 * flush, it can't answer, the fetch times out, and the bridge's 2s hard cap
 * trips (~24% of hooks in the v3.24.0 dogfood). Tiers (1) and (2) remove that
 * dependency for the common case.
 *
 * The env fast path (2) is taken ONLY when ALL hold:
 *   - the signal carries WMUX_PTY_ID. A pane's daemon session id is
 *     topology-STABLE: it does not change when the active surface switches, so
 *     resolving it against a slightly stale list is safe. A `workspaceId`-only
 *     hook resolves to the workspace's `activePtyId`, which IS focus-sensitive —
 *     a stale value would misroute hook authority / dedup / lifecycle, not just
 *     a toast — so those keep the authoritative fetch.
 *   - the last-known list is younger than STALE_TRUST_MS. Beyond that we stop
 *     trusting an arbitrarily old map and block on a fresh fetch (a renderer
 *     dead >10s is exactly when we SHOULD wait for it).
 *   - the cached list contains the pane's OWN id — checked via
 *     `resolvePtyIdForSignal(...) === signal.ptyId`. This is the load-bearing
 *     guard (codex + GLM P1/P2): it must NOT be a bare truthiness check on the
 *     resolver, because the resolver's workspaceId/cwd FALLBACK would resolve a
 *     newly-created pane (whose ptyId isn't cached yet) to some OTHER pane's id.
 *     Fast-pathing on that would route the new pane's authority / resume-binding
 *     / dedup to the wrong pane until the next refresh — the exact cross-pane
 *     resume-binding clobber the X6③ exact-ptyId routing was added to prevent.
 *     The resolver returns EXACTLY `signal.ptyId` only when its exact-ptyId
 *     branch fires (id present in the list + workspace cross-check), which is
 *     the topology-stable case; any fallback returns a different id.
 *
 * On the env fast path (2) we `prime()` the cache (fire-and-forget) so it stays
 * warm for the next hook without blocking this one. A mirror hit (1) needs no
 * prime — the renderer refreshes the mirror on its own push cadence. In both
 * cases `fetchMs` is 0 (no round-trip) and `fastPathed` is true so the flood
 * meter can report how many hooks were absorbed without a fetch — a green
 * "0 degraded" during a real flush storm would otherwise hide the saturation
 * (GLM P2). A mirror hit counts as fastPathed, never degraded.
