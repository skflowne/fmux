// ─── Command Deck — durable decision gate (M1) ──────────────────────────────
//
// A brain-raised, restart-surviving "I need a human decision" checkpoint. The
// orchestrator brain calls the MCP tool `deck_ask_decision` (→ pipe RPC
// `deck.requestDecision`) when it hits a fork only a human should settle; the
// pending decision is persisted here and BLOCKS that workspace's auto-wake loop
// (CommanderEventCoalescer / DeckScheduler consult `hasPendingDecision`) until a
// human resolves it in the Deck UI (ipcMain `deck:decision:resolve`). On resolve
// the brain resumes with the resolution injected into its next turn
// (`withLoopContext` → `renderDecisionBlock`).
//
// Because it is an atomic JSON file in the wmux data dir — the exact pattern of
// deck-loop-state.json — it survives an app close / reboot for FREE: no extra
// reboot code, consulted fresh on the first post-restart flush/tick.
//
// This is NOT a cage on the brain: the brain CHOOSES to pause (its own
// judgment). It is deliberately distinct from MCP plugin-trust approval
// (ApprovalQueue), the pane-agent `approvalPress` pre-authorization, and the
// human-initiated loop `paused` state — do not conflate.
//
// Storage: one JSON file (`deck-decisions.json`) in the wmux data dir, atomic
// write, WMUX_DATA_SUFFIX-isolated, keyed by workspaceId (at most one active
// decision per workspace). Read-modify-write per mutation against the CURRENT
// file so a concurrent edit isn't clobbered by a stale in-memory copy. Never
// throws — a torn store must never brick the wake loop.
