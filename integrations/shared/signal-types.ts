// Canonical agent signal envelope.
//
// Any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Aider, OpenCode, Copilot)
// that integrates with wmux via the hook plugin pattern emits signals
// shaped like AgentSignal. HookSignalRouter dispatches on `kind`, never
// on `agent`. Per-agent quirks live in the bridge script that translates
// the agent's native hook payload into this envelope.
//
// This file is wmux-INTERNAL. Bridge scripts in integrations/<agent>/bin/
// are .mjs (self-contained, no TS imports possible from the plugin runtime).
// Bridges duplicate-declare these shapes locally as plain object literals.

/**
 * The kind of signal. Dispatch keys at the daemon side.
 *
 * - agent.stop            — agent finished its turn. Strongest "task done" signal.
 * - agent.activity        — per-tool-call activity ping (optional, may be dropped if too noisy).
 * - agent.subagent_stop   — subagent finished (e.g. /team mode coordinator).
 * - agent.session_start   — agent session began. Used to clear stale metadata.
 * - agent.awaiting_input  — agent paused for input. Two emitters: the regex
 *                           AgentDetector (single-line y/N or approval prompts),
 *                           AND the Claude Code hook bridge, which maps a
 *                           PreToolUse hook on the AskUserQuestion tool to this
 *                           kind (the boxed multi-line question UI never matched
 *                           a detector regex). Both route through the same
 *                           HookSignalRouter ledger shape used for `agent.stop`.

 * Canonical envelope. All fields are required UNLESS marked optional.
 *
 * Routing priority (main-side, `resolvePtyIdForSignal`):
 *   1. `ptyId` (from WMUX_PTY_ID env, injected by the daemon at spawn) —
 *      EXACT per-pane key. Trusted only when it still maps to a live
 *      workspace pane. Resolves the multi-pane-in-one-workspace and
 *      shared-cwd cases that workspaceId+cwd alone collapse (every pane's
 *      hook would otherwise route to the workspace's active surface).
 *   2. `workspaceId` (from WMUX_WORKSPACE_ID env, set by wmux PTYManager)
 *      — strong signal. When the user runs Claude inside a Forge Mux pane,
 *      the env propagates through Claude Code's subprocess spawn and
 *      lands here. Deterministic regardless of cwd overlap between
 *      workspaces, but resolves only to the workspace's active surface.
 *   3. `cwd` — fallback for sessions started outside a wmux pane, OR
 *      for older bridges that don't fill the env fields. Resolved via
 *      exact + longest-prefix match against `workspace.metadata.cwd`.
 *
 * `surfaceId` is carried for forensic continuity but is NOT a routing key:
 * the renderer mints a surface only AFTER pty.create returns, so WMUX_SURFACE_ID
 * is never actually injected into the pane env. WMUX_PTY_ID supersedes it.
 *
 * Bridges MUST set `cwd` (workflow user expects), MAY set `workspaceId` /
 * `surfaceId` when the env is available. Codex round 1 P1 #7 + user
 * dogfood report 2026-05-24 (workspace 4 turn-end → workspace 2 toast)
 * promoted env-first from deferred TODO to required.
 *
 * `ts` is the hook FIRE time in Unix ms, captured by the bridge before
 * the RPC roundtrip. Used by SignalLatencyMeter to compute the
 * (hook fire → wmux receive) delta. The wmux daemon adds its own
 * receive timestamp at HookSignalRouter and stores both.
 *
 * `agentSessionId` is opaque to wmux. For Claude Code it's the session
 * id from the hook payload; for codex it would be the process pid.
 * Carried for forensic logging only — routing never depends on it.
