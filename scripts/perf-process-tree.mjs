// Pure process-tree collection for the A1 RAM scenario (perf-bench.mjs
// measureRam). Split into its own module — with NO shebang — so it can be
// imported by both perf-bench.mjs and a vitest test
// (scripts/__tests__/perfProcessTree.test.mjs). A leading shebang makes the
// Windows-CI vitest loader throw a SyntaxError (known repo gotcha — see the
// same note atop perf-compare.mjs), so this file must stay shebang-free.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #570)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// measureRam() used to walk `ParentProcessId` links from the app + daemon pids
// and trust every edge. Windows does NOT reparent orphans and does NOT clear a
// dead process's ParentProcessId, so a process whose real parent exited keeps
// pointing at that stale pid forever. Once the OS recycles that pid onto one of
// OUR processes, the orphan (and its entire subtree) starts looking like our
// descendant, and the walk sums a foreign subtree into wmux's RAM total.
//
// This is not theoretical: the CI run that tripped the Perf gate on PR #569
// collected 157 processes instead of the usual ~25, and the extra 136 processes
// contributed 3.7 GB of working set while wmux's own buckets (main 114M /
// renderer 178M / gpu 120M / utility 43M / daemon 126M) were indistinguishable
// from a passing run. Working set and commit both scaled by the same ~2.4x, so
// the metric choice was never the problem — the tree membership was. A snapshot
// of an idle developer desktop (356 processes) still showed 4 such phantom
// edges live at that moment, so the failure mode is always armed and CI, which
// churns through thousands of short-lived processes, just hits it more often.
//
// THE INVARIANT WE ENFORCE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A real child is always created AFTER (or in the same millisecond as) its
// parent — spawning requires a live parent. So an edge P → C where C's
// CreationDate predates P's cannot be a real parent/child link; it is a stale
// pid pointing at a recycled slot. Rejecting those edges (and, with them, the
// subtree hanging off them) removes the contamination deterministically instead
// of statistically. Win32_Process.CreationDate is readable for every row —
// unlike CommandLine, it is not access-gated — so the check is never a coin
// flip: all 356 rows of the desktop snapshot above carried a timestamp.
